🧩 K-Means Clustering Algorithm for Unsupervised Learning Tasks through Storytelling
📖 Overview
Why not let the data tell its own story? This project explores K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, in a creative storytelling format. The task involves clustering universities into two categories—Private and Public—without using their actual labels during clustering. The goal is to demonstrate how K-Means identifies hidden patterns in data and analyze how closely the clusters align with reality when compared to the true labels.
In addition to applying clustering, this project emphasizes learning through creativity, blending technical concepts with storytelling to enhance understanding. 🌟

🔍 Method
The project follows these key steps:
Data Collection and Preparation: 📊 Load the dataset containing information about universities.
Data Preprocessing: 🔄 Standardize the data using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on the same scale.
Clustering with K-Means:
Set the number of clusters to 2 (for Public vs. Private). 🔢
Run the K-Means algorithm to group universities based on feature similarity.
Evaluation: 📈 Although K-Means is unsupervised, the clusters are compared with the actual labels using:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
This is done purely as a learning exercise to observe how well the algorithm performed.

📊 Outcome and Results
The K-Means algorithm successfully divided the universities into two clusters. ✅
The confusion matrix revealed how well the clustering aligned with the actual categories.
Although the clustering wasn’t perfect, it showed that K-Means can identify meaningful patterns in the data even without labeled information. This exercise highlights the potential and limitations of clustering algorithms in real-world scenarios. 🔍

🔧 Data Processing
Loading the Dataset: 📥 The dataset consists of university-related features like student population, faculty ratio, and other key metrics.
Scaling the Data: ⚖️ Using StandardScaler, each feature was transformed to ensure fair comparison and avoid biases from varying magnitudes.
Clustering: 🧑‍🏫 The K-Means algorithm was applied with 2 clusters to separate universities into Private and Public categories.
Validation (Optional): 📋 Compared the generated clusters to true labels, revealing insights into K-Means' performance.
