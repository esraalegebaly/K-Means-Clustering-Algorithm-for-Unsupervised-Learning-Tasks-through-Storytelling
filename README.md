# K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm-for-Unsupervised-Learning-Tasks-through-Storytelling
 Clustering algorithms work best when labels are unknown, as they are designed to explore structure in the data without prior guidance. However, comparing the algorithm’s clusters with known labels can help evaluate how well the clustering aligns with real-world categories—but it’s not the ultimate goal.
